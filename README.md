# Social Network API

## Description

I needed to build a social network API system that could run excellently. This process was challenging to say the least. It used Express.js, MongoDB database, and Mongoose ODM to operate. The end goal was a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list which it was all able to run quiet well.

## Installation

`npm install`
